A minimalistic  content like system created in Laravel 10, to Manage personal data of my contents in youtube and pinterest to post simple tech tips.
I make this with two things in mind, first i have mecioned before and second Increment my Laravel Skills.

You need to have Instaled this for use and aprimorate this project
XAMPP or Anoter web server solution
PHP 8.2
Composer 2.5
And the configuration that can be required by this, the erros logs will guide you haha!

To use this you can clone this project and create a .env file inside the project to configure your enverioment.

change the name of .env.sample for .env 

And after running the XAMPP run in the terminal inside the project like /opt/htdoc/repository/eduardoc-tips the command 

    php artisan serve

if you receive errors like 500 you can need to generate key using

    php artisan key:generate

for more information i recommend to explore the documentation of used tools
